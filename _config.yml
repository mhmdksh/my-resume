  Hello, world! I'm Mohamad Shehab, a seasoned IT professional, AI integration specialist, and a self-confessed automation addict. When I'm not busy managing the full spectrum of IT services and cloud solutions for multinational companies, you'll find me exploring the fascinating worlds of Web3 and Artificial Intelligence.

  My journey in IT has been an exciting ride, from working on mission-critical systems to creating reliable cloud solutions and building AI-powered tools that enhance developer workflows. I'm a firm believer in the power of continuous learning, constantly leveling up my technical skills—whether that's implementing LLMs or orchestrating cloud infrastructure—and gaining XP points in the game of life.

  In the realm of DevOps, I'm a wizard, conjuring up solutions that enhance efficiency and reliability. My magic wands? My extensive IT administration, AI integration, and automation skills. But don't worry, I haven't forgotten the importance of soft skills in this digital age. I'm always working on those to ensure I'm not just a code-crunching machine, but also a human who values connections and teamwork.

  Ready to embark on a quest in the world of IT services, AI solutions, and cloud infrastructure? Let's connect!
